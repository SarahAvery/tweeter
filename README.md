# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

"This repository is the starter code for the project: Students will fork and clone this repository, then build upon it to practice their HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills, and their Node, Express and MongoDB back-end skills."

## Current State

A Single Page App (SPA) built with HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX only.

This app currently does not have a database - any mock tweets will be lost once the server has stopped running. This implementation is to be included at a later date.

## Getting Started

1. Fork this repository, then clone your fork of this repository.
2. Install dependencies using the `npm install` command.
3. Start the web server using the `npm run local` command. The app will be served at <http://localhost:8080/>.
4. Go to <http://localhost:8080/> in your browser.

## Dependencies

- Express
